# Digital Closet

An app for which main purpose to be help us make more toughtful, mindful and sustainable decisions for our wardrobe.


## Main features

Wish List - purchases planner. It's a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) section, where user can add new purchases with main information (name, price, link). Mark items, when they are purchased and track how much money was spent or needs to save based on   how many are needed to purchase. 

Closet - digital clothes storage. User is allowed to upload items for their devices and see the list of the uploaded items immediately on a page. For this feature, Firebase was used as a storage. Important note: I'm aware based on good practises such data as firebase api key has to be hidden and treated as a secret. But for this project was made an exception temprorar

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.
